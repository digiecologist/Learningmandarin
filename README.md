Please can you create a list of the top 50 phrases I might encounter using those above on a week-long cultural exchange tour with work where I am visiting tech companies, suppliers and emersion in the Chinese culture. I want to appear friendly and like I have made an effort. Please include things such as "I only speak a little Chinese, can you repeat that slowly please, do you speak English. I need to know the phonetics, the corresponding question and answer combinations given the scenarios already discussed and the kanji for reading please
Using these top 50 phrases and the component words please can you create a Mandarin language app for me to practice with. 
Please can you build this application to be a simple web app with a simple user interface. The user should be presented with a preference screen where they can enter the following: 
•	Name
•	Age
•	Marital status
•	Dietary preference
•	Hobbies
•	Likes
•	Dislikes
•	Job
•	Anything else
Each entry should be filled to progressed apart from the mandatory “anything else” field. The user should enter information in each field then be able to click a submit button. On submit the user will then be presented with 4 options:
1.	Rapid fire
2.	Chatter
3.	Parrot
4.	Update Preferences
On completion of the preferences, the user responses will be cached and the app will not aske for them to be entered again unless the user chooses to. 
Options should be displayed on tiles, each one a different colour. When the user clicks on the tile they should be directed to the appropriate game, preference screen or exit screen. 
Each option is outlined in detail with format and process below:
Menu Option 1 - Rapid fire game
This game tests the user by showing 5 tiles on the left hand of the screen with Mandarin kanji and the associate Pinyin on. The user is also presented with five similarly formatted tiles on the right hand of the screen with the English (UK) translation of the mandarin words. The pairs will be randomised so the correct right hand tile is not on the same row as the corresponding left hand tile at any time. 
The user must match the Mandarin word with the English word to be awarded a point. If an incorrect match is made then an error sound is played and the user must guess again. If a correct guess is made the user is played a success noise and is awarded a point. If an incorrect guess has been made for a mandarin tile, the user can not score any points for it. The round of tile matching is complete when all five pairs are made correctly. The game proceeds with another two rounds so the user is presented with a total of three rounds. A maximum score of 15 points can be awarded. 
On completion the user will be presented with a screen outlining their score. The score will correspond to an animal and a celebratory animation. The rating is as follows: 
•	0 – Frog
•	1-5 Panda
•	6-10 Tiger
•	11-14 Eagle
•	15 Dragon
The animation will show confetti and the spinning emojis of the corresponding animal based on the users score. 
On completion of the three rounds, and having seen their score the user can click play again or back to main menu tiles. Clicking play again starts the game again with a new set of words randomly selected from the catalogue. Back to main menu takes the user back to the main screen with the four menu options:
1.	Rapid fire
2.	Chatter
3.	Parrot
4.	Update Preferences
Menu Option 2 - Chatter Game
The chatter game tests the users ability to understand and answer a question. They will be presented with a question shown to them in mandarin kanji and pinyin. They can click a button to “play audio” and also a “play again” button. 
When they are ready they can then click a “answer” button. The app will then use the available microphone as audio input to listen to the users answer to the question. For example the question could be: 
App: “what would you like to drink”
User speaks: “I would like a cup of coffee please”
The app then rates the audio they have heard into three categories: 
1.	Sounds great, well done!
2.	Could do a bit better
3.	Not quite, try again
If the answer is rated as 2 or 3, the user can click a “try again” button which will be displayed. They will then be allowed to try to answer again. A maximum of three tries is allowed. If unsuccessful, they can move onto the next question by clicking a “move on” button which will be displayed after a third unsuccessful attempt. 
If the answer is rated as 1 – sounds great the user will be shown their next question. 
2 points are awarded for a successful first time 1. Rating. If the user scores a 2 or 3 rating then the max they can score for any future successful attempt at that question is 1 point. If they are unsuccessful on their 3 attempts then they score no points. 
This game has 10 questions and a maximum score for the game of 20 points. On completion of the ten questions, the user will be presented with a screen outlining their score. The score will correspond to an animal and a celebratory animation. The rating is as follows: 
•	0 – Frog
•	1-5 Panda
•	6-10 Tiger
•	10-18 Eagle
•	18-20 Dragon

Menu Option 3 – Parrot Game
The parrot game is a simple game of repeating the word presented to the user on a tile. The tile should show the mandarin kanji and the pinyin associated with it. The user can click on the tile to play the audio of the Mandarin pronunciation. Any subsequent clicks on the tile will play the word again.  
When they are ready they can then click a “answer” button. The app will then use the available microphone as audio input to listen to the users attempt at the word.
